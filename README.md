# Synchronize_Folders

Disclamer: This is a project just for fun and to code a little bit. I am not using third party libraries that implement this process with ease.

There are to files in this project the main file and the synchronize file.

HOW TO START THE PROGRAM:

In the command line:
Example -> python main.py --main /Users/User/../main_folder --copy /Users/User/../copy_folder --log /Users/User/../log.txt
