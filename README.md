# Synchronize_Folders

Disclamer: This is a project just for fun and to code a little bit. I am not using third party libraries that implement this process with ease.

There are two files in this project the main file and the synchronize file.
The main serves just to start the program and the synchronize has the synchronization code (everything is docummented).

The program will register your logs in the terminal and in the log.txt for every move you made in the path that you choose.

HOW TO START THE PROGRAM

In the command line:

Example -> python main.py --main /Users/User/../main_folder --copy /Users/User/../copy_folder --log /Users/User/../log.txt


WARNING:

There are some flaws in the program for now, will be improved in the future.
